# Mobile & USB Forensics with Cryptocurrency Tracking

## Overview
Performed mobile extraction and USB artifact analysis; detected steganography, decrypted hidden communications, and correlated wallet logs with bank transactions.

## Tools & Skills
- Cellebrite Physical Analyzer
- ExifTool
- Pixelknot (steganography)
- Wallet/Blockchain explorers

## Environment / Setup
Use lawful test images or synthetic data; never upload real personal data.

## Steps
1. Extract mobile/USB data; compute hashes and document acquisition.
2. Analyze metadata with ExifTool; detect stego via Pixelknot; attempt decryption where lawful.
3. Correlate wallet logs with transaction records; document findings.

## Key Artifacts
- `notes.md` – analysis notes
- `correlation-examples/` – synthetic mapping examples

((## Screenshots
> Place redacted images in `./screenshots/` and reference them:

## Outcome / What I Learned
Demonstrated device forensics and financial tracing techniques.

## How to Reproduce (Optional)
Follow the notes and use synthetic sample datasets.
